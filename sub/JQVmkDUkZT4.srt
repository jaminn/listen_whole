1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:02,193
Are you your body?

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,824
Well, kind of, right?

3
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:07,869
But, is there a line
where this stops being true?

4
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:12,999
How much of yourself can you remove
before you stop being you,

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,979
and does the question even make sense?

6
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:29,605
Your physical existence is cells,
trillions of them,

7
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:33,115
at least ten times more
than there are stars in the Milky Way.

8
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,345
A cell is a living being, a machine made
of up to 50 thousand different proteins.

9
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:44,419
It has no consciousness, no will,
no purpose; it just is,

10
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:46,930
but it is still an individual.

11
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:51,768
Together, your cells form huge structures
for jobs like preparing food,

12
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:54,983
gathering resources,
transporting stuff around,

13
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,022
scanning the environment,
and so on.

14
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,753
If you extract cells from your body
and put them in the right environment,

15
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,746
they will continue to
stay alive for a while,

16
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:10,356
so your cells can exist without you,
but you can't exist without them.

17
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:14,522
If we take all the cells away,
there is no "you" anymore.

18
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:19,122
Is there a line where
a pile of your cells stops being you?

19
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,994
For example, if you donate an organ,
billions of your cells will continue

20
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,686
to live on inside someone else.

21
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:29,751
Does this mean that a part of you
became a part of another person,

22
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:33,982
or is this other body
keeping a part of you alive?

23
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,600
Or, let us imagine an experiment:

24
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:39,956
you and a random person
from the street exchange cells.

25
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:43,776
One at a time, your body
gets one of their cells;

26
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:45,508
their body gets
one of your cells.

27
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:48,013
At which point would they become you?

28
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:53,257
Would they ever, or is this just
a very slow and gross way to teleport you?

29
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:56,075
Let's make this more complicated!

30
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,657
The image of ourselves as
a static thing is untenable.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,386
Almost all of your cells have to die
during your lifetime.

32
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:07,900
Two hundred and fifty million have died
since the beginning of this video, alone,

33
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:11,129
between one and three million per second.

34
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:17,419
In a seven-year period, most of your cells
are replaced at least once.

35
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:22,449
Every time your cells' setup changes,
you are slightly different than before,

36
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,324
so a part of you is dying constantly.

37
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,752
If you are lucky enough to become old,

38
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:32,279
you would have cycled through roughly
a million billion cells,

39
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:36,758
so what you consider yourself
is really just a snapshot,

40
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,745
but sometimes, cells are broken
and don't want to die

41
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:43,702
questioning the very nature
of the unity of our bodies.

42
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:48,264
We call them cancer. They cancel
the biological social contract

43
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,305
and become basically immortal.

44
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,271
Cancer is not an outside invader;

45
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,724
it's a part of you that
puts its own survival over yours,

46
00:02:56,724 --> 00:03:00,740
but you could also argue that a cancer
cell becomes another entity inside us;

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,062
another being that just wants to
thrive and survive.

48
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,795
Can we blame it for that?

49
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,504
A chilling cell story is that of
Henrietta Lacks,

50
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:12,140
a young cancer patient who died in 1951.

51
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:15,496
Usually, cells only survived
for a few days in the lab,

52
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,496
making research very hard.

53
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,186
Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal.

54
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,501
Over the decades, they were multiplied
over and over again

55
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,460
and used for countless research projects
saving countless lives.

56
00:03:28,023 --> 00:03:31,623
Henrietta's cells are still alive
and overall have been grown to

57
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:33,974
at least 20 tons of biomass,

58
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:37,484
so there are living parts around the world
from someone who has been

59
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,287
considered dead for decades.

60
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:42,007
How much of Henrietta is in these cells?

61
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,058
What makes one of
your cells "you," anyway?

62
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:50,104
Maybe the information contained in it,
your DNA?

63
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:53,536
Until recently, it was believed that
all the cells in your body

64
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,570
had basically the same genetic code,

65
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,819
but it turns out this is wrong.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,108
Your genome is mobile,
changing over time

67
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,669
through mutations
and environmental influences.

68
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,259
This is especially the case in your brain.

69
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:12,111
According to recent discoveries, a single
neuron in an adult brain has more than

70
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,385
one thousand mutations in its
genetic code that are not present

71
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:19,760
in the cells surrounding it,
but how much "you" is your DNA, really?

72
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:24,340
About eight percent of the human genome
is made up of viruses that once

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,730
infected our ancestors and merged with us.

74
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:31,497
Mitochondria, power plants of the cell,
once were bacteria that merged

75
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:35,940
with the ancestors of your cells.
They still have their own DNA.

76
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:40,528
An average cell has hundreds of them,
hundreds of little things that are

77
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,555
not really human,
but they still kind of are.

78
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:47,436
It is confusing.
Let's backtrack a bit.

79
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,997
We know that you're made up of
trillions of little things

80
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,139
made from more little things
that are constantly changing.

81
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:58,081
Together, all those little things
are not static, but dynamic.

82
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:02,248
Their composition and condition
is changing constantly,

83
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:06,614
so we might just be a self-sustaining
pattern without clear borders

84
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:10,217
that gained self-awareness at some point
and now has the ability

85
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,645
to think about itself
through time and space,

86
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,186
but really only exists in
this exact very moment.

87
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,281
Where did this pattern start:

88
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:22,474
with your conception,
when the first human arose,

89
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:25,906
when life first began
conquering our small planet,

90
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:29,530
or when the elements that make up your
body were forged in a star?

91
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:33,177
Our human brains evolved
to deal with absolutes.

92
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:37,154
The fuzzy borders that make up reality
are hard to grasp.

93
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:43,216
Maybe ideas like beginning and end,
life and death, you and me,

94
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:48,198
are really not absolutes, but ideas
belonging to a fluent pattern;

95
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:52,913
a pattern that is lost in this strange
and beautiful universe.

96
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:57,241
The problem of who we are isn't just

97
00:05:57,241 --> 00:06:00,680
a question of ourselves,
but it's also a question of our minds.

98
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:06,083
Just as our cells can be divided and
separated from us, so can our very brains

99
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,020
be divided and separated from us
while still in the skull.

103
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,326
you should really change that now.
