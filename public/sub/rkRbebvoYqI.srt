1
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:15,747
Imagine a world

2
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,892
in which you see numbers and letters as colored

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,750
even though they're printed in black,

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,833
in which music or voices trigger a swirl

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,922
of moving, colored shapes,

6
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:25,858
in which words and names fill your mouth

7
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,592
with unusual flavors.

8
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,437
Jail tastes like cold, hard bacon

9
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:33,123
while Derek tastes like earwax.

10
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:35,807
Welcome to synesthesia,

11
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:37,072
the neurological phenomenon

12
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:41,032
that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population.

13
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:43,505
A synesthete might not only hear my voice,

14
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,413
but also see it,

15
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:44,920
taste it,

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,555
or feel it as a physical touch.

17
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:51,065
Sharing the same root with anesthesia,

18
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:52,400
meaning no sensation,

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,152
synesthesia means joined sensation.

20
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:57,446
Having one type, such as colored hearing,

21
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,699
gives you a 50% chance of having a second,

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,116
third,

23
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:01,609
or fourth type.

24
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:06,764
One in 90 among us experience graphemes,

25
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,312
the written elements of language,

26
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:08,975
like letters,

27
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:09,434
numerals,

28
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:10,797
and punctuation marks,

29
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:12,850
as saturated with color.

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,313
Some even have gender or personality.

31
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:19,502
For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty,

32
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:22,319
9 is a vain, elitist girl.

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,694
By contrast, the sound units of language,

34
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:25,946
or phonemes,

35
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:27,863
trigger synestetic tastes.

36
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:30,369
For James, college tastes like sausage,

37
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,411
as does message and similar words

38
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,206
with the -age ending.

39
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,542
Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes,

40
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,125
rather than a disorder

41
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,754
because there's nothing wrong.

42
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,104
In fact, all the extra hooks

43
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,997
endow synesthetes with superior memories.

44
00:01:45,997 --> 00:01:49,309
For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago.

45
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,346
"Let's see, she had a green name.

46
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,310
D's are green:

47
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,847
Debra,

48
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,229
Darby,

49
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,646
Dorothy,

50
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,146
Denise.

51
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes! Her name is Denise!"

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,359
Once established in childhood,

53
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,736
pairings remain fixed for life.

54
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,254
Synesthetes inherit a biological propensity

55
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,282
for hyperconnecting brain neurons,

56
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:08,017
but then must be exposed to cultural artifacts,

57
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:08,870
such as calendars,

58
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,536
food names,

59
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,245
and alphabets.

60
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,833
The amazing thing is that a single nucleotide change

61
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,378
in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception.

62
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:19,793
In this way, synesthesia provides a path

63
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,049
to understanding subjective differences,

64
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,385
how two people can see the same thing differently.

65
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,972
Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food,

66
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:30,303
such as milk, oranges, and spinach.

67
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,691
The gene heightens normally occurring connections

68
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,939
between the taste area in his frontal lobe

69
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:37,481
and the color area further back.

70
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,269
But suppose in someone else

71
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,683
that the gene acted in non-sensory areas.

72
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,579
You would then have the ability to link

73
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,772
seemingly unrelated things,

74
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:47,948
which is the definition of metaphor,

75
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,787
seeing the similar in the dissimilar.

76
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:52,997
Not surprisingly, synesthesia is more common

77
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:55,374
in artists who excel at making metaphors,

78
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,541
like novelist Vladimir Nabokov,

79
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,293
painter David Hockney,

80
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:00,693
and composers Billy Joel

81
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,219
and Lady Gaga.

82
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,002
But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes

83
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,583
understand metaphors like "sharp cheese"

84
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,632
or "sweet person"?

85
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:12,009
It so happens that sight,

86
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:12,342
sound,

87
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:12,891
and movement

88
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:15,300
already map to one another so closely,

89
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,732
that even bad ventriloquists convince us

90
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,646
that the dummy is talking.

91
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,478
Movies, likewise, can convince us

92
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,526
that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths

93
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:25,694
rather than surrounding speakers.

94
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,447
So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes,

95
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,449
outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings

96
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,533
happening all the time.

97
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,748
Cross-talk in the brain is the rule,

98
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,435
not the exception.

99
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:41,010
And that sounds like a sweet deal to me!
